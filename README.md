# NumberGuessingGame
The fun and easy project “Guess the Number” is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:
The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 50.
The user will guess and enter the number.
The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
The game continues till the user's guessed number is equal to generated random number.
Points are rewarded according to attempts.
